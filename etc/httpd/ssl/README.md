The included web server configuration uses SSL certificates located in this directory. You may put/symlink your certificates 
here or you may use the self-signed certificates in the sub-directory ```self-signed```. Either way the configuration expects
the certificates to be named ```xtrade.rosasurfer.com.crt``` and ```xtrade.rosasurfer.com.key```.
